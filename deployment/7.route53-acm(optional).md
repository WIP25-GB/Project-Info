## ⚙️ Chapter 7: Route53 & ACM

In this chapter, we will walk through purchasing a domain via AWS Route 53, issuing an SSL/TLS certificate through AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), and attaching the certificate to your Application Load Balancer (ALB) to enable HTTPS for your application.

### 7.1 Buy a Domain Using AWS Route 53

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).

2. Navigate to **Route 53 > Domains > Registered domains**.

3. Click **Register Domain**.

4. Enter the desired domain name (e.g., `ratingo.ca`) and check availability.

5. Select the domain if available and click **Add to cart**.

6. Complete the registration by providing contact information and payment details.

7. After successful registration, the domain will appear in your **Registered domains** list.


### 7.2 Issue an SSL/TLS Certificate Using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

1. Navigate to **AWS Certificate Manager** in the **same region** as your ALB (e.g., `us-east-1`).

2. Click **Request a certificate**.

3. Select **Request a public certificate** and click **Request a certificate**.

4. Enter your domain name(s):

   * For the root domain: `ratingo.ca`

   * For the wildcard subdomains (optional): `*.ratingo.ca`

5. Click **Next**.

6. Choose **DNS validation** (recommended).

7. Click **Next**.

8. Review and click **Confirm and request**.

9. ACM will provide **CNAME records** for DNS validation.
